`printf("Hello, World!\n");`

It feels only right to start my first blog post with that iconic line. If you're reading this, welcome to my new corner of the internet! This is a mandatory "first post" as a chance for me to introduce myself and set the stage for what's to come.

### Who Am I?

My name is Athul Kamath, and I'm currently a B.E. Computer Science student at Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU). Like many in this field, I'm driven by a deep curiosity about how things *really* work. It's not enough for me to just write code; I want to understand the entire stack, from the logic gates firing billions of times a second to the operating system managing it all.

This fascination has naturally led me to a few key areas of interest:

* **Computer Architecture:** The art and science of designing computing systems. I'm captivated by the low-level details of CPUs, memory hierarchies, and instruction sets.
* **Operating Systems:** The beautiful complexity of the software that bridges hardware and applications.
* **Compilers:** The magic that turns our high-level, human-readable code into efficient machine instructions.
* **Systems Programming:** Writing software that operates close to the hardware, where performance and efficiency are paramount.

I'm also a huge proponent of open-source software and a dedicated Linux user. I've spent my entire college journey so far living in a terminal, customizing my environment, and enjoying the freedom and control that the Linux ecosystem provides.

### Why a Blog?

I'm starting this blog for a few reasons. First, it's a way for me to document my learning journey, as the best way to solidify knowledge is to try and explain it. Second, I plan to share notes and project deep-dives. In fact, a perfect example is my recent progress with the **Nand2Tetris** course. I'll be posting shortly about completing the first project—building elementary logic gates from scratch—which has been a fantastic hands-on experience. This blog will be my space to document that journey and similar explorations.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussion, collaboration, or just a good tech chat. You can find me in a couple of places:

* **GitHub:** Check out my projects at [github.com/pixelpip](https://github.com/pixelpip)
* **Email:** Feel free to reach out at [atu@kamath.app](mailto:atu@kamath.app) or [athulkamathg5@gmail.com](mailto:athulkamathg5@gmail.com)

Thanks for stopping by. I'm excited to start sharing what I learn. Stay tuned!
